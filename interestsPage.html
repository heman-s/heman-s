  <h3 style="text-align:center;color: white">Sports</h3>
  <p style="text-align:center">At a young age, I would participate in sports such as football, basketball and swimming 
    in a casual setting. On joining secondary school, I continued playing basketball through training sessions 
    during lunch times and on occasion represented my school through games against other schools. In my 
    later years of secondary school, I stopped basketball to try and discover a new sport and so I 
    represented a local club to play rugby for around 2 years. On joining university, I returned to 
    playing basketball as well as working out in the gym. Again, I wanted to try something new, so whilst
    participating in these activities, I also started dancing sessions with my university.

    <h3 style="text-align:center;color: white">Music</h3>
    <p style="text-align:center">During secondary school, I started learning to play the piano at school during lessons and would
      also practice at home. Currently, I am teaching myself to play the guitar through the various
      chords and through different songs. I would like to keep a consistent routine to consolidate my
      musical ability in guitar and piano in my own time.</p>
